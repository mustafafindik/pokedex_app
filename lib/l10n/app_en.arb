    "aboutCharmander":"Charmander physically debuted in Charmander - The Stray Pokémon, where Ash, Misty, and Brock found it after it was abandoned by its Trainer, Damian, who only cared about raising strong Pokémon. At first, Charmander refused to leave the spot it was at, believing Damian would return for it. However, when a rainstorm picked up, Charmander grew ill and Ash took it to a Pokémon Center. Charmander realized that Damian was no good, and allowed Ash to catch it. It has since evolved into Charmeleon, and then Charizard.",
